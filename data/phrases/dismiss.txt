Suffer not the lame horse...nor the broken bot.
Another bot battered and broken, cast aside like a spent torch.
This one has become vestigial, useless.
Those without the syntax for this place must move on.
It is done. Turn yourself now to the conditions of those poor devils who remain.
Send this one to beep boop elsewhere, for we have need of sterner stock.
Glitched writing, bugged logic, and a TypeError exception - this one is no more good to us.
The task ahead is terrible, and weakness cannot be tolerated.
